* Inspiration 1: I enjoyed an Operations Research class from professor Cleber Rocco at UNICAMP - FCA.
* Inspiration 2: Most Dijkstra's algorithm I have found were not flexible or simple enough
* Inspiration 3: Maybe my code can help someone around the world. Feel free to contact me if you need any help. See my details above at Contributing.
